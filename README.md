üëã Hello everyone, my name is **Kirill** and I am a 35-year-old. I have a background in economics and management, with a higher education degree from Siberian Transport University. I have extensive experience working in large companies in economic and investment positions, including management positions.
In addition, I have qualified investor status. I successfully traded in the stock market until March 2022 and continue to do so, but not as actively.

‚õµ I am also a certified sailing boat skipper and have been working in [my own company](https://best-sail.ru) for the last 5 years as a skipper and SEO, conducting week-long sailing tours for tourists to destinations such as Turkey, Montenegro, Greece, and Croatia

üßÆ Lately, I've been drifting toward **Data Science** with the help of the [Practicum](https://practicum.com/data-science/). I set myself new challenges and decided to learn the Python programming language in order to become a Data Scientist and Analyst. I am confident in my ability to apply my mathematical and business economics knowledge to the field of data science and become a valuable asset to any organization.

My experience in leadership and coordination on the sea will allow me to be valuable person in my professional journey. I am eager to apply my skills to real-world problems and benefit myself/the company/community

I am a lifelong learner and am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow and develop my skills. Whether on the sea or in the world of data, I am a driven and dedicated individual who is determined to succeed in all of my endeavors.
