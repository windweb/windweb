üëã Hello everyone, my name is **Kirill**, and I am a professional with a rich background in economics and management, holding a higher education degree from Siberian Transport University. My career has spanned various large companies, where I have held economic, investment, and management positions, including obtaining qualified investor status. Although I've been successful in stock market trading up until March 2022 and continue to participate, albeit less actively, my primary focus has shifted toward the field of quality assurance.

üîç Quality Assurance Experience:
My main professional focus is on QA testing. I have developed a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach to problem-solving through my experience as a QA Tester. My responsibilities have included designing and executing test plans and cases to ensure software reliability and quality. With proficiency in both manual and automated testing, I have utilized tools like Selenium WebDriver, PyTest, and Postman to identify software bugs and verify that functionalities meet the required standards. This role has deepened my understanding of the technical interaction between data and software, emphasizing the importance of accuracy and precision.

‚õµ Leadership and Coordination:
In addition to my QA testing expertise, I am a certified sailing boat skipper and have led [my own company](https://best-sail.ru). I've organized week-long sailing tours for tourists to destinations such as Turkey, Montenegro, Greece, and Croatia. This experience has not only enriched my leadership and coordination skills but also instilled in me the value of teamwork and strategic thinking in achieving common goals.

üßÆ Data Science and Analytics as a Hobby:
Lately, I've been nurturing my interest in Data Science and analytics as a hobby, thanks to the [Practicum](https://practicum.com/data-science/). While this is not my primary professional pursuit, I am dedicated to learning the Python programming language to delve into data science and analytics. This interest reflects my commitment to lifelong learning and my eagerness to apply my mathematical and business economics knowledge in new areas. On GitHub, I engage with the community by learning through parsing other people's projects and sharing solutions to problems encountered along the way.

üë®‚Äçüíª GitHub Contributions:
My GitHub activities reflect my journey through QA testing and my hobbyist interest in data science. I share insights, offer solutions to testing challenges, and collaborate on projects that intersect quality assurance and data analysis. This engagement showcases my belief in continuous improvement and my desire to contribute meaningfully to the tech community.

In conclusion, my career is a blend of professional QA testing focus, enriched by leadership experience on the sea and a hobbyist interest in data science and analytics. I am a driven individual, determined to excel in my endeavors and eager to apply my diverse skill set to real-world problems, benefiting myself, the company, and the community.

üë®‚Äçüíª On GitHub, I mostly learn by parsing other people's projects and posting some of the solutions to problems I encounter while learning.
